# Real-World Super-Resolution
A PyTorch implementation of the [SRResCGAN](https://github.com/RaoUmer/SRResCGAN) model as described in the paper [Deep Generative Adversarial Residual Convolutional Networks for Real-World Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/). This work is participated in the [NTIRE 2020](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire20/) RWSR challenges on the [Real-World Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/).
